# Fake News Detection Project - README

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project! This project aims to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between real and fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Dataset:
The project uses a labeled dataset containing real and fake news articles.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
- other libraries as specified in the project files

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:
1. Ensure that you have downloaded the necessary dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

3. Explore the notebooks in the "notebooks" directory to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.

## Model:
The project implements a machine learning model based on natural language processing techniques. It uses algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural networks, depending on the specific implementation.

## Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on a separate test dataset using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This ensures that the model's performance is objectively assessed.

## Results:
The final results and performance metrics of the trained model are provided in the "results" directory. Additionally, the project may include visualizations or reports showcasing the model's performance.
